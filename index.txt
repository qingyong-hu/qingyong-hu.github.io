9:T636,I am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), working with [Prof. Qian Zhang](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/). My work lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), ubiquitous sensing, and deep learning, with the goal of building efficient, robust, and intelligent systems for smart healthcare and wireless applications. I recently received the ACM IMWUT Distinguished Paper Award (2025) for our work on contactless arterial blood-pressure monitoring.

My research agenda currently focuses on three thrusts:

- **AIoT for Smart Healthcare** - In-home monitoring for neurological diseases (mmTremor, PDAssess) and continuous blood pressure measurement (WaveBP, PracticalBP, Ubicon-BP).
- **AI-empowered IoT System Optimization** - Compact feedback-free CSI compression (CSI-StripeFormer) and predictive models for MIMO channels (CS3T-UNet).
- **Robust and Scalable Machine Learning** - Collaborative projects on periodic reasoning for multimodal LLMs (Period-LLM) and graph transformers (HGT, FedGT).

## Appointment & Education

- **2025 - present** - Post-doctoral Research Fellow, CSE, HKUST
- **2020 - 2025** - Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST (advised by Prof. Qian Zhang)
- **2015 - 2020** - B.Eng. in Computer Science, School of the Gifted Young, USTC

This paper analyzes the algorithmic complexity of contracting Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), when applied to MBL Hamiltonians. We prove that while the exact contraction is #P-complete, approximate contraction schemes based on singular value decomposition (SVD) truncation exhibit polynomial time complexity with bounded error for short-time evolution. However, we identify a "complexity phase transition" at the ergodic-MBL transition point, where the bond dimension required for a fixed accuracy diverges exponentially. We propose a novel adaptive bond-dimension algorithm that optimizes computational resources by exploiting the area law of entanglement in the localized phase, demonstrating superior performance on Heisenberg spin chains.},

  abstract = {The precise time-evolution of quantum systems is a cornerstone of computational physics. This paper investigates the numerical stability of high-order Runge-Kutta (RK) methods when applied to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We derive rigorous stability boundaries for symplectic and non-symplectic RK integrators and demonstrate that specific implicit schemes preserve unitarity over extended simulation times. By analyzing the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian operator, we establish a relationship between the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition and the imaginary eigenvalues characteristic of quantum propagators. Our findings are validated through simulations of wave packet scattering and harmonic oscillator dynamics, showing that our proposed optimized RK coefficients significantly reduce phase error accumulation compared to standard integrators.}

  abstract = {The behavior of spin systems on curved geometries offers a unique window into the interplay between topology and statistical mechanics. This study employs extensive Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase transitions of the 2D Ising model mapped onto hyperbolic lattices (Poincaré disk). We utilize the Wolff cluster algorithm to overcome critical slowing down near the phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that the critical exponents on negatively curved surfaces deviate significantly from the standard Onsager solution for flat Euclidean lattices. Specifically, we observe a suppression of the correlation length divergence, suggesting a mean-field-like behavior induced by the exponential expansion of the lattice volume. These findings have implications for understanding quantum gravity models and holographic duality.}
